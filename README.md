# (Re)analyses of published RNA-Seq data

This repository contains the files needed for processing and analyzing published RNA-Seq datasets. The results are hosted at [The Lair](http://pachterlab.github.io/lair/).

The analyses can also be run independently with:
```
snakemake -p ---configfile {filename}/config.json
```

where ```{filename}``` should be replaced by a file corresponding to a dataset.
